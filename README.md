BeaconColorEngine(BCE), despite its impressive name, is a simplistic python program that takes a user input of their desired hexadecimal colour and provides a visualisation as to what colour glass blocks they would need to construct said hexadecimal colour

## Notes

> [Validation]: There is no user validation so the correct format of hexadecimal #RRBBGG is required.
  [Computation]: using more than 5 glassblocks results in exceptionally high computation time.
